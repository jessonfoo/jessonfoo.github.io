					<b><em>Cultural Blog: Pairing in DBC</em></b>
						<br>
						<br>
					<b>Pairing & Feed Back</b>
					<br>
					<b>Pairing</b>
						<br>
					<p>Pairing in dbc has been a very beneficial experience in my time at DBC. For the first few weeks of phase 0, I didnt pair very much because I am naturally an introverted person and I generally have a fear of meeting new people. I tend to stay inside my bubble and work alone which causes me to have tunnel vision when approaching challenges. However, once I began pairing I realized that having a partner to work with made chlallenges far easier in many ways.</p>
					<br>
					<p>
					The first thing I noticed was that I got through challenges much more quickly, my partners and I bounced ideas off each other offering our individual opproaches to solving a problem. I benefitted from them when they introduced new methods, and when they explained areas that I was unfamiliar with and vice versa. It was particularly fun to get to know them, and extremely rewarding when I was able to elucidate a portion where I might have slightly better understanding. The most difficult thing for me was driving. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to maintain complete silence while driving, or whether I was allowed to offer my input. Another thing was when I was navigating.
						
					</p>
						<br>
					<b>Feedback</b>
						<br>
					<p>Feed back was something that was encouraging during phase 0. When goign looking at the feedback that other's wrote, sometimes I would come across very detailed and in depth feedback responses. Those responses I found exceptionally helpful. When writing, I feel as if I don't really know what to say to them, I try my best to be actionable specific and kind, but in general, I feel as though I am a very laid back guy. I don't have too many gripes with people, and try to see the best in them. Because of this, it is easy for me to be kind, but hard to identify specifics and give actionable feedback. I feel that this is something that I need to work on.
					</p>
					<br>
					
					<p>
						For the most part, feedback has been mainly helpful in encouragement. Pairing on the other hand is far more beneficial in the learning aspect. I feel that I am able to learn best when I interact with others rather than reading what I need to improve on, or what I excel at. The best feedback tells me areas that I can improve on that I didn't know I was behind in. Many times the difficult part of writing feed back was trying to tell them something they don't already know about themselves. Also it is difficult when I am pairing with the same person more than once.
					</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Pairing & feedback as a whole</b>	
					<br>
					<p>
						Overall, I think pairing is a great way to learn because you get to teach and learn in the process. I enjoy interacting with my pairs, especially when they are open to interacting with you as well. I feel that feedback is harder to benefit from, and is a double edged sword, while recieving feed back is necessary to understand your flaws, it doesnt tell me how I can improve on writing better feed back. It seems to be more trial and error.
