					<b><em>Cultural Blog: Problems in the Tech World</em></b>
						<br>
						<br>
					<b>Being Too Minimalist</b>
					
					<b>Minimalists & Instant Gratifcation</b>
						<br>
					<p>Smaller is better, lighter is better, the less buttons, the easier it is to use. These are the things that we have come to look for when we buy things. In some ways simpler is better, but not at the cost of knowing how to do things the old fashioned way.
						<br>
					<b>The Tech Illiterate</b>
						<br>
					<p>It's one thing for the elderly to find it difficult to operate new technology, but its another thing for the younger generations to be just as confused. It amazes me how many people have difficulty installing programs or applications if you can't drag and drop it. The other day, a friend of mine told me he wanted to buy a mac because his laptop was getting slow. He just got it a year ago, I took a look and realized he had at least 4 search bars on his browser, and every piece of bloatware corporate laptops come standard with. I explained to him what his problem was, and he brushed it off as if I were crazy. He said he tried deleting the "programs" by dragging them to the recycle bin. Oh yeah, his recycle bin was maxed out. He didnt understand that shortcuts are just directions to an folder containing various folders and references all working together to create a program. Dissillusioned, he said, macs are easier, theres no program files folders and subfolders, just app icons that work.
					</p>
					<br>
					<b>What can we do?</b>
					<p>
						Technology is what makes us human. The first pieces of technology were weapons made to hunt and give us an edge over the beasts of this planet. Our technological advances have come so far that people expect things to just happen without them doing anything. I think that fundamentals of technology should be a requirement in schools. Every child should know what RAM means, and is used for as well as the CPU, and how everything works. They should know that Mac's have the same basic elements as a pc, and the only difference is the operating system. Even within the operating system they should know that the "app icons" are more than just icons, and that they contain sub folders, it's genius, but sadly leaves some of us more braindead.
