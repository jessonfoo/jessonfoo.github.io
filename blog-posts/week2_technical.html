			<h2><b>Margins Vs Borders Vs Padding</b></h2>
				<p>
					One of the most confusing things about learning HTML and CSS were the differences between the margin, the border, and the padding on html elements. Every element in HTML can be seen as a box with 3 layers. The margin is the outer most part, the border is right inside of that, followed by the padding which is the space between the border and the content.

				<p>The best way to illustrate these aspects of CSS is the boxmodel.</p>

			<h3><b>Margins</b></h3>
				<p>
					A margin is a term that many people are familiar with, if you've written a paper, you're probably used to hearing "please use a margin of ____." The term margin in the context of CSS is quite similar. It is the invisible portion that surrounds the entire element. 
				</p>
			<h3><b>Borders</b></h3>
				<p> 
					The border of an element is the largest colored portion. The color property is inherited from the box element. You can see the limit of the border element by setting the element's border property.
				</p>
			<h3><b>Padding</b></h3>
				<p>
					The padding clears space between the border and the actual element's content it has no color, but is affected by whatever the background color of the box.
				</p>
			<h3><b>Content</b></h3>
				<p>
					The content is the most basic feature of an element. It is at the center of everything is where the text or image will be shown.
