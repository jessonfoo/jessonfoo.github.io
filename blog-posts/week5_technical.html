					<b>An Introduction to Classes</b>
						<br>
					<p><em>What is a class?</em>In the programming world, a class is a template for creating an object. Every object in ruby is a class. Even creating a variable with the value nil has a class; the NilClass. Classes also have a heirarchy. Using IRB, you can play around with objects in ruby by calling the class method on them, and then calling the superclass method. In my experience the top of the heirarchy is the BasicObject. Here is a basic diagram of the heirarchy of classes.

						<b>More Classes</b>
					<p>The Classes above are just some of the basic classes that are predefined in Ruby. Classes can also be made in the same way that methods are made. For example, in the image above, dog is not a predefined class in ruby, but by defining it by typing Class Dog we have made it a Class. Also as you can see above, the super class of Dog is Animal. When a class is created, a common instance method, initialize, is usually the first thing to be created. The initialize method sets up the parameters of the new instance of your Class. Additionally, your class should have various methods that you can call upon. </p>
