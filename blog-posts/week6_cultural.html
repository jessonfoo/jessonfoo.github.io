					<b><em>Cultural Blog: Experiences in Regard to Stereotype Threat</em></b>
						<br>
						<br>
					<b>Stereotype Threat</b>
					<br>
					<b>What is Sterotype Threat</b>
						<br>
					<p>Stereotype threat revolves around the notion that when one percieves that his or her peers have a preconcieved notion of what or how they will perform, that risk is increased. This is primarily a concept that is geared towards eliminating negative stereotypes, because naturally a positive stereotype is not something that is necessarily seen as a problem. However, in a sort of meta-stereotypical way it can be.</p>
						<br>
					<b>My Experiences with stereotype threat</b>
						<br>
					<p>
					Typical negative stereotypes are things like asians can't drive well, African Americans aren't as good as white students at school, or even non racial stereotypes like fat people don't excercise. However there are also many stereotypes that lean in the positive direction. For example, Asians tend to be good at math, African Americans tend to be tall, fast, and strong. While stereotype threat deals with the negative stereotypes, which I have experienced as true to some extent as well, I feel that it all comes down to one's self-esteem.
					</p>
					<br>
					
					<p>
						In my experience, when people imply that your odds of success are low, it can take a toll on your self-esteem. Hitler said in <em>Mein Kampf</em> if you repeat something enough times, you start to believe it as a truth. I have seen this happen many times in school, kids think that they won't understand or do well on a subject so they dont try as hard because they expect to fail. Unless the benefit of success is so much greater than the cost of the effort they neeed to put in. Nobody enjoys failure, and nobody wants people to see them fail. So, if a task is seen as something out of reach, one might be inclined to intentionally fail or not try at all. In their minds, if they never tried, they never failed.

					<br>
					<b>Meta-Stereotype Threat</b>	
					<br>
					<p>
						As an Asian, everyone expects you to do well in school. You're expected to excel and compete to be at the top of the class. While this is a positive stereotype, there was a time in my life that it was the bane of my academic existence. How? Simple, I failed to get a perfect score on one exam, and slowly i set lower and lower standards. Eventually because I still believed I was born smarter than all the other kids, I chose to intentionally not try on my homework, and sometimes on exams.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Since I was born, I was priveleged with spending nearly every waking moment with my parents or a mentor who was constantly motivating and teaching me. I was nurtured in a way that was super-stereotypical of asians, with an enormous emphasis on success. I was raised believing that I was smarter than the other kids, not knowing that it was a result, not of my genetics or nature, but the time and effort my parents spent to teach me. In the first grade I performed at the level of a 4th grader. By 6th grade I was reading classic novels such as a tale of two cities, pride and prejudice, the adventures of tom sawyer, and huckleberry finn. I truly believed that I was naturally smarter than my peers, genetically I thought I had an advantage over them. My teachers told me I was "gifted" and "learned at an incredible rate." Admittedly at the time I was performing well beyond what was expected of me, but as my pride grew, so did my ego. What's better than being better at everyone? Being better without having to try. My self-esteem inflated to a degree that I believed I could outperform every student in my school without even trying. Naturally my grades slipped, but I also found it easier to accept that they were slippinng. I went from being a star pupil into being a class clown, it took far less energy, and my peers accepted me more. Also failure to perform as expected characterizes me as a failure, and what is stereotypical of failures?</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Everyone has 20/20 in hindsight, therefore its not important to dwell on the past, anyone can say "If I did this, I would have been better off." To be even more cliche, "its not about where you start in a race, it's about where you finish." While Shereef said in the contexts of programming, that "we're all on a the start of a 1000 mile journey with some people having taken a few steps and others a hundred." I would apply this to everyday situations by asking myself or anyone who fears failure, to think of it not as a journey of a thousand miles, but Marathon with everyone in the world, both friends and foes. If youre part of the team, are you going to be the one  to drag them down? You've got a long way to go to get to the finish line. Think youre too slow? Plenty of people are just starting the same marathon, the important thing is that you keep moving forward. Sprinters get tired, and those who never try never succeed. "Do something enough times, and you will get good at it." - Statistics
