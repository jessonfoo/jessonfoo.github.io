					<b><em>Cultural Blog: Affirmation & Stereotype Threat</em></b>
						<br>
						<br>
					<b>What Are My Values?</b>
					<br>
					<b>1:Accomplishment, Achievement, Challenge & Status</b>
						<br>
					<p>
						I would branch these values all into one section, that feeling when you meet your goal, when you got to the finish-line. It feels good finishing first, and it feels good finishing anything altogether. When I think of these values, I think of graduations, when a student sees all of his hard work paying off.
					</p>
						<br>
					<b>2:Affection,Compassion, Close Relationships, Romance</b>
						<br>
					<p>
					I Would put all of these values into one broader category as well. Romance is a good word that comes to mind when I think of these values. Romance is a natural thing to all humans, it's what natural selection left us with to reproduce. The word romance is mostly associated with that first girlfriend or boyfriend that you get, and you can never spend enough time with them. The times when you have those funny little phone calls where its silent for 10 minutes straight but its totally ok. Everyone wants love, its built in to our dna, thats why rejection hurts so much.
					</p>
					<br>
					<b>3:Autonomy, Commitment, Control, Credibility, Effectiveness</b>
					<br>
					<p>
						When I think of these values, it reminds me of 'words you want to put on your resume.' The amazing thing
						about these values is that whether they are true or not, is entirely upto you. You have complete control
						over how true you want to make each value, and how true each is. While these words look good on paper, for me, they have been repeated so many times, I just dont believe them any more. I use them to describe myself & others, but I choose to gauge one's grit by working with them. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>How much do I try to live up to each value?</b>	
					<br>
					<p>
						on a scale from one to five where five represents strongly agree, and one represents strongly disagree,
						I would say I try to live up to the first category; success, at a 4. I value it at a 4 and not a 5 because I believe that the path to success is just as important. I also believe the amount of time spend with loved ones correlates to lower success, but higher happiness. Therefore, I try to live out the second category; romance, at a 3, a neutral level. I'm open to the idea of having a close relationship with someone, but I'm not actively seeking one. It's always fun to have a close relationship, and naturally we desire it, but in the end, there also always tends to be heartache for one party or another.
						I try to live up to the last category at a 4.5; this is the highest out of all the values I've rated. I find these words trite, nonetheless, their intrinsic values remain as characteristics that I want to have, and try to. I wan't control over what I can and can't do. I wan't to chart a course, and follow through no matter what. I wan't other's to know that I'm this way, and that they can count on me. Lastly, I want to be good at what I do. No matter what it is, it's natural that you want to be good at it.
					</p>
						<br>
						<b>The last topic that someone asked for my advice on?</b>
						<p>
							The last real topic that I've given advice on was probably on the topic of romance. My friend was talking to me about a person they liked, and what course of action to take. I told them we're all the same, the only advice I can give is try and spend quality time with them. This means you figure out what qualities they value first and incorporate that into future contact. The only thing I can say for sure is that nothing is for sure. One day this person can like you, the next day it can be someone else. But where, what & with who you spend most of your time on is a panorama of what you value.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							When I think about my values, the first thing I tend to think is did I overstep my boundaries? That leads me to the autonomy, and control and efficacy category. I realize I want to be able to take each step prominently without second-guessing myself. Once in a while I think about romance when I feel particularly alone. I definitely think that remembering my values will help overcome stereotype threat. I hope that I will remind myself of my values if I ever come face to face with stereotype threat and realize it.
