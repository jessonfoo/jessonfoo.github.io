				<h3><a href="http://uncrate.com/" target="_blank">Uncrate</a></h3>
				<p>
					Uncrate is one of my favorite websites to check when I have nothing to do. The first thing that you'll notice about this website is the pictures. Theres lot's of them. They're also especially eye-catching because almost everything on the site is something that you can purchase and hand selected by the authors. I would categorize the layout of this website as "minimalist." The only problem I can see this website solving is advertisement. Because the nature of this website is writing about cool things you can buy, it practically screams "pay me and I'll write about your item." There are actual advertising spots that are cleverly snuck in, but they are marked as advertisements. 5 adjectives I would use to describe the content would be "sleek," "trendy," "modern," "cool," and "alluring." In terms of navigation, it is relatively straight forward, there is a button to see "more stuff" which is essentially a next page button, and a back button. Aside from this it can be hard to navigate. Finding something you once saw can be very difficult, but there is a search bar. It can be very easy to lose track of time and end up browsing the site for hours, but because of how long the site has been around, it is difficult to browse through all of the site's content. When I first discovered the website, I would stop browsing when I realized how much time I had spent there and would feel like I wasted my time. These days, I stop browsing when I finish looking through the day's posts. This leads to a much happier experience. In the 3-4 years that I have been following the site, I have made at least one purchase that was influenced by this site's content.

				<h3><a href="http://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">Reddit</a></h3>
				<p>
					Reddit is by far one of the most popular websites on the internet. The first thing you notice when you look at the site is that IT LOOKS BORING. There are so many words, and the pictures are so tiny. Everything looks so blue, it looks like a forum. I would describe reddit's as initially cluttered, simple, brilliant, and forum-like. Reddit is a website that is user driven. All the content are submitted by other users and the Homepage is made up of posts that are voted most popular by other users. voting for a post is as simple as clicking an up-arrow, upvoting, or the down-arrow, downvoting. The problem that is solved by reddit is finding interesting content. Before I found reddit, viral videos and internet phenomena reached me by word of mouth. Reddit puts a whole new meaning on viral. If your video or post reaches the front page, you can be sure it's had at least 10,000 hits in just one day. Unfortunately, reddit is also well known for it's terrible search-engine. Finding a post you once saw is practically impossible unless you've saved it. Because reddit is a site that's content is comprised of user submissions, it is impossible to get through all of it. After I've been on the site for a while, I definitely get the feeling that I've been wasting too much time. However I can also say that, somehow, it never gets old. Reddit does have an online store, but it is rarely advertised, and consequently I have never made any purchases.

				<h3><a href='http://theimpossiblecool.tumblr.com/' target="_blank">Impossible Cool Tumblr</a></h3>
				<p>
					Impossible Cool is a website hosted on Tumblr. Tumblr, is one of the most popular blogging sites for images. The first thing you notice about "The Impossible Cool's" website is the simplicity of the design. The title simply reads "The Impossible Cool" in black font over a white background. The rest of the website is similarly images posted on a white background. What's the most eyecatching however are the images themselves. The content of the images posted can be categorized as "artistic," "retro," "stylish," "vintage," and "hip." As far as navigation goes, it is near impossible to go anywhere but to the next page. That being said, I've never wanted to do anything but that. There is no search, only an option to view older posts. If you see something you like, you had better bookmark it, because you won't get to see it again unless you want to spend lot of time looking at old posts. Compared to Uncrate and Reddit, The Impossible Cool's content is far less expansive and thus much easier to get through all of it. Also it is one of the sites that makes me feel relatively happy when I look at it, but I have never spent "too much time" on it and can not really speak from experience as to how I feel after spending a great deal of time on it in one sitting. So I suppose that means that it would be boring.
