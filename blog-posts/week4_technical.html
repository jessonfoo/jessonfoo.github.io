					<b><em>Arrays vs. Hashes. What are they? What are they good for? How do you know which one to use?</em></b>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
					<b>An Introduction to Arrays and Hashes</b>
						<br>
					<p>Arrays and Hashes are two of the most common ways to collect and store information. Arrays are one of the fundamental collections in ruby. It can store objects of any nature including fixnums, strings, and even other arrays. In other words, its sort of like a list that you can store anything in. Like everything else in ruby, Arrays are objects too, so you can create new arrays using the Array.new method. Another way to create an array is to simply type out a name for the array, and assign it values with brackets. for example, Jesson = [23, 'asian','item in list',[]]. from here you can access individual items in the array using the items index. the first item in the array always starts at 0. so to access the the string 'asian' is as simple as typing Jesson[1].</p>
						<br>
					<p>Hashes are like the array's more organized and uptight brother. Like an array, you can make a Hash by simply defining a variable but using curly brackets like this. jesson = {}. you can use the constructor jesson = Hash.new('value'). The cool thing about Hashes is that you can be more organized because you get to sort the items in your list by keys, but unlike arrays, just typing jesson = Hash.new(3) does not create three items inside of your Hash. What you are doing is setting the default value for the new hash. What can be confusing is that even though you can create a single default value in the hash.new constructor, but the size of the hash will remain 0 unless there is a key. Keys can tend to be strings, symbols, or instance objects. without a value, a list of hash keys are basically just a list with default values. Thus, Hashes must come in key value combinations. </p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
					<b>When to use Arrays and When to Use Hashes</b>
						<br>
					<p>deciding whether you want to use an array or a hash can be difficult, but if you think about how you want to recall the items you are storing the choice becomes more simple. If you simply need to store a list, that doesnt need to be in order, but can be sorted and compared, an array is the default collector. When you are storing things such as prices of certain items, or something that you can't simply find by looking up the index, you'll want to use a hash.</p>
