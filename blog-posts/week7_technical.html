					<b><em>SQL vs NoSQL</em></b>
						<br>

					<p><em>SQL</em> is programming language specialized for database management. In It is commonly referred to as<em>RMDBS</em> or called by the acronym <em>"SEQUEL"</em> relational database management system. It's purpose was to In my opinion, SQL isn't much of a programming language at all since it's scope of operations is so limited. SQL was designed in order to store data in tables that were easily searchable.
					The syntax of sql typically follows a certain pattern for everyoperation.
					</p>
					<p>for example to craeate a table, it would look something like this</p>
					```sql
						CREATE TABLE example(
 						field1 INTEGER,
 						field2 VARCHAR(50),
 						field3 DATE NOT NULL,
 						PRIMARY KEY (field1, field2)
						);	
 					```
 					As a Language SQL is primarily composed of a few elements: clause expression statement
 					once the tables have been made the most common operations are querries regarding whether is something in one table or another. There are several visibly common words that occur in sql syntax that querries; that is:
 					```sql
 					FROM
 					JOIN
 					WHERE
 					GROUP BY
 					HAVING
 					ORDER BY
 					```
 					Here is an example of these clauses being used in an example

					<b>SQL vs NoSQL:Whats the big deal?</b>
					<br>
					<p>
						To most peple. the words SQL and NoSQL have no meaning. However, as web developers, we live in a world 
						where we extensively debate on which of these seeminglessly meaningless words mean.
					</p>
					<p>
						As I explained in my introduction, SQL is a database technology invented to quickly store and retrieve data. SQL was one of the first database technologies used and distrubuted by multiple companies, but most notably, Microsoft's SQL Server. Naturally over time, people discover loopholes in the technology. One well known exploit is called SQL injection.
						Hopefuly this image below will explain how hackers exploit SQL injection.

						<p>
							As you can see, SQL injection exploits the the vulnerability of leaving open fields that inject the argument into the sql block of code.
