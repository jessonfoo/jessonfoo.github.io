					<b><em>Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</em></b>
					<br>
					<b>The DBC Experience</b>
					The DBC experience to date has been one of self-discovery. In many ways I was learning things about myself. Areas where I excelled or struggled, and certain tendencies about myself. I often found myself working against the clock. I found myself spending more time on sections that I excelled at because it was fun when I should focus on improving my understanding in weaker areas.
					<b>Impressions</b>
					When I first heard about DBC, I thought "ok great, I've always wanted to my hand at programming at here's a shortcut to do it." I can't say that I don't still see DBC as a fast track to becoming a developer, but my mindset definitely changed. Where before I wanted to get by with as little work as possible, I now understand that DBC is process where I will get what I put in.
					<b>Cultural integration</b>
					I see fitting in to the culture of DBC as a challenge that I look forward to nervously. It will take an effort on my part to recondition myself to the values of DBC, but I am certain that it will be a positive change. 
					<b>Impact</b>
					I found this video comforting in some ways, and gut-wrenching in others. While it was nice to know there were people who had a similar mindset when coming into dbc, it was scary to be called out. I definitely related to the group of people who thought of themselves as having a good a relatively strong background for programming. I found my arrogance subdued by fear when I saw some of the background of some of my peers. at the same time, hearing the analogy of being a group of people who are all starting a journey on foot at different starting positions but at the tip of the iceberg alltogether. While I know that I should be embracing the challenge set before me, the emotions that have been rationalized are ones of nervousness.
