					<b><em>Why is JavaScript popular in web development? What are the great things about JavaScript? What are it's limitations?</em></b>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
					<b>JavaScripts Prevalence in Web Development</b>
						<br>
					<p>Javascript is one of the most popular scripting languages in web development because it is easily implemented in html and css. It's useful because it can be viewed by anyone viewing the webpage. It's usefulness is vast in the sense that it can be used for very simple scripts, but also to write very complex. It's syntax is also familiar because of its object oriented nature.</p>
						<br>
						<br>
					<b>What's so great about Javascript?</b>
						<br>
					<p>Javascript is great because of how easily it can be incorporated into html & CSS. You can also use html within javascript by calling on DOM and using get element id. It also provides a way for the script to interact with the user. It's also able to be used outside of web pages in other types of documents. It provides functionality that html and css can not such as writing functions that can iterate or loop incorporating if/else statements & such.</p>
						<br>
						<br>
					<b>Limitations</b>
						<br>
					<p>The biggest limitation with JS is that there are various security vulnerabilities. Also some bugs are not caught because the JS is not reachable.</p>
