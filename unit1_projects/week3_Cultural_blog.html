					<b><em>Cultural Blog: Your Thinking Style and Learning</em></b>
						<br>
						<br>
					<b>I am an Abstract Sequential thinker and I have a Multimodal Aural Kinesthetic learning style.</b>
					<b><h3>Traits of an Abstract Sequential thinker</h3></b>
					<h4>As a learner I like</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>to be heard out</li>
							<li>analyzing situations before making a decision or acting</li>
							<li>applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems</li>
						</ul>
					<h4>I learn best when</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>When I have a experts to reference</li>
							<li>placed in stimulating environments</li>
							<li>able to work alone</li>
						</ul>
					<h4>Things I have trouble with</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Being forced to work with those of differing views</li>
							<li>Too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly</li>
							<li>Repeating the same tasks over and over</li>
							<li>Lots of specific rules and regulations</li>
							<li>"sentimental" thinking</li>
							<li>Expressing their emotions</li>
							<li>Being diplomatic when convincing others</li>
							<li>Not monopolizing a conversation</li>
						</ul>

						<br>

					<b>Application</b>
						<br>
					<p>Knowing that these things, I am excited to start interacting with people in real life, and having actual mentors at DBC. Having realized my weaknesses, I have been trying to correct the ones that might cause the most problems such as not monopolizing a conversation, and listening to others.</p>
						<br>
					<b>Experiences during phase 0 & hopes for the future</b>
						<br>
					<p>My biggest struggles during phase 0 related to my learning style has been having too little time to deal with subjects thoroughly, and working with a lot of specific rules and regulations. For example, when I was behind on week 2, I felt extremely stressed because I didn't want to just go through the motions of doing the challenges, but I felt like I had to which made me very anxious. What has helped me was the section on time management. The article I read about using unconventional methods of time boxing worked very well for me. I used it this week by giving myself an early due date for the assignments so that I would have time to go back later and review what I found difficult. The biggest change I want to make in terms of my mindset is how I approach Challenges, I want to embrace challenges when I feel like I am short on time. I also want to learn to see criticism as feedback that I can learn from.</p>
