		<h2> Introduction</h2>
		<h4><em>About me</em></h4>
		<p class="main">
		Hello, my name is Jesson, I was born and raised in Southern California near Los Angeles. I graduated from UC Irvine in 2013. This is my webpage for Dev Bootcamp's Phase 0 unit 1 html section. It is the first page of my education at DBC and I expect that it will be far from my last.
		</p>
		<br>
		<b>Why am I here?</b>
		<br>
		<p class="main">
		I am attending Dev Bootcamp because I ,obviously, want to be a developer. I have been fascinated by technology and programming. However as a result of my parent's experiences, they advised me not to pursue a career in programming. This was because they saw many programmers lose their jobs because they were no longer competent, they failed to keep up with the latest programming languages.</p>
		<br>
		<b>Looking Ahead</b>
		<br><p class="main">
		After graduating with a degree that I didn't really care about, I couldn't figure out what to do. Time and time again, people told me that if programming was what interested me then I should do it. After all I'm the one who has to live with the decisions that I make, not my parents.
		<br></p>
		<b>Experience</b>
		<br><p class="main">
		By no means would I consider my knowledge of coding "advanced," that being said I am not without experience either. As a boy I loved looking at html, even if I didn't understand it completely. I figured out how to make my own page by early highschool. During my time at UC Irvine, I took a a course in JavaScript. I am now happy to add DBC to my list of experiences with programming.
